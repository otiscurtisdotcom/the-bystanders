              A London comedy of meddling manners, boozy nights, poltergeist pranking, workspace satire, and personal development. It is sweet, funny and schlumpily humane.

              British sci-fi comedy that channels the scrappy energy of a young, Spaced-era Edgar Wright with the ambition of Doctor Who.

              A winning comedy of ill manners. Haran and Walsh have terrific comic chemistry together, and the supporting cast deliver fun performances. The Bystanders comes strongly recommended.
