          <p>
            British independent film The Bystanders is an off-the-wall, sci-fi comedy set in a parallel dimension â€“ a world in which invisible immortals watch over their subjects and intervene in their lives, often not for the better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Filled with mysterious moments, The Bystanders mixes surrealism with retro sci-fi and classic silent comedy set-pieces to create a wry satire on modern city life.
